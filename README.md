## 01: Hybrid-LinkedList-with-array for best time complexity:
#### Time complexity : O(1) for both lookup,insert,remove
We know that array is best for lookup and linked-list is not good for lookup that's why we push linked-list in the array for getting better time-complexity and we also know that array is not good at inserting and removing data so we use both linked-list and array getting time complexity O(1) using Hybrid Data Structure.

## 02: Quick-Sort with three-median-pivot for best time complexity:
we know that quick sort average time complexity is O(nlogn) and worse case time complexity is O(n*2) because for selecting the pivot always first or mid or last.
In this case the time complexity is always O(nlogn) because I change the pivot always for every recursion
