## 01: Hybrid-LinkedList-with-array for best time complexity:

#### Time complexity : O(1) for both lookup,insert,remove

We know that array is best for lookup and linked-list is not good for lookup that's why we push linked-list in the array for getting better time-complexity and we also know that array is not good at inserting and removing data so we use both linked-list and array getting time complexity O(1) using Hybrid Data Structure.

## 02: Quick-Sort with three-median-pivot for best time complexity:

we know that quick sort average time complexity is O(nlogn) and worse case time complexity is O(n\*2) because for selecting the pivot always first or mid or last.
In this case the time complexity is always O(nlogn) because I change the pivot always for every recursion

## 03: Doubly Linked List:

This implementation has a doubly linked list which contains nodes that have two pointers to other nodes. The first pointer points to the next node and the second pointer points to the previous node. Time Complexity for all operation is O(1) except removing the last element from the doubly linked list
