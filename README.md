## 01: Hybrid-LinkedList-with-array for best time complexity:
#### Time complexity : O(1) for both lookup,insert,remove
We know that array is best for lookup and linked-list is not good for lookup that's why we push linked-list in the array for getting better time-complexity and we also know that array is not good at inserting data so we use both linked-list and array getting time complexity O(1)
